# Business Problem


### The main purpose of the collection of datasets is to predict accommodation prices, analyze and estimate listing prices based on region or other features
### Before prediction, we are going to make exploratory data analysis and understand the dataset by using some visualization tools
### After we've done that, we are going to create new features and show importance scores, edit features based on feature importance on the dataset
### ML algorithms will come after beyond that and predicted values calculation will be made.
